Fees and Prices

* CaptchaCO.IN is free and will always be free for everyone to use and integrate. However, to keep-up with maintenance like server and other website and staff expenses needed to keep the site and service running 24/7, we will deduct a processing fee of 2% if not 0.001 BTC or which is higher per pay captcha payment transaction. Which means if someone pays you through your pay captcha installation of 0.01 BTC we take 2% of it which is 0.001 BTC and you keep 0.009 BTC but if your pay captcha installation earns 0.1 BTC we will deduct a fee of 0.002 BTC which is 2% of the whole transaction.
